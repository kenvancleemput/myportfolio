        <p>
          When I was young, I also got involved in party management. This ranged
          from small parties in Zazou, a small club in Lier, to larger
          gatherings in Hangar 26 in Antwerp. I was also a known face in the
          Belgian party scene, often aiding with building up and breaking down,
          and earned the trust of many organisations so that I was allowed to be
          the man at the ticket booth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew out of it when I started my career as an accountant, both
          because my musical taste evolved and combining party organiser with a
          full time accountant career wasn't conducive to either. I do, however,
          still look back with pride at the events I've organised, and the
          lessons I've learned in that time organising events from 50 to 600
          people.
