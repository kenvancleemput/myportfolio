      <h2>The DEATH series</h2>
      <p>
          <h3>Protagonists</h3>
          The main protagonists of the DEATH series of books are obviously DEATH, but also his extended family. There's his butler, Albert, and his adopted daughter 
          Ysabell. The first book, Mort, introduces us to these three, as well as to his apprentice, Mort. He rides a white horse named Binky. In his second novel, Reaper Man, he gets 
          fired by the Auditors, and hilarity ensues as he tries to adopt to a "normal" human life. In Soul Music, we meet Susan, DEATH's granddaughter, who has inherited certain family traits, 
          like being able to pass through walls. When DEATH goes missing, she is expected to take up his mantle. In Hogfather, the titular character goes missing and DEATH tries to replace him
          so humanity keeps believing in the Hogfather, a Discworld standin for Santa Claus.In the meantime, Susan tries to find out what is happening and why her grandfather can be spotted with a fake beard...
          In Thief of Time, the story focuses on the monks of history, who make sure that time happens as it should. We also meet the fifth rider of the Apocalypse here, who left before they made it big.

          <h3>Antagonists</h3>
          During the novels, DEATH has multiple runins with the Auditors of reality, the beings tasked with making sure that everything in the Discworld universe follows the Rules. Embodied as floating robes with a 
          hive mind, they're not allowed to develop a personality or a sense of self. If one of them does so, they vanish and a new Auditor pops into place. They often clash with DEATH, as they would very much like 
          the world to be less chaotic. This leads to several plots which DEATH has to stop. Renimiscent of classical accountants and auditors, they lack a sense of humour and can get easily distracted by illogical things. 
          Another enemy of DEATH in one novel are his own memories, which lead to his disappearance in Soul Music and his attempt at forgetting the painful moments of his life. While handled quite humorously, anyone who 
          has ever wished that they could forget certain parts of their own life will be able to step in his bones and walk his journey with him.

          <h3>Influences</h3>
      </p>
          Every novel has it's own theme and things that get ridiculed. Mort takes a look at apprenticeship and the expectation that young people can make the decision what They
          want to do with the rest of their lives. Reaper man takes a look at rural life, and how strange the human mind works when it comes down to rituals and habits. Soul Music has many
          references to sixties and seventies rock music, coupled with DEATH's depression. Hogfather looks at Christmas, and the role imagination plays in being human. It also riffs on Mary Poppins, when 
          Susan takes a job as a caretaker of children. Thief of time looks at monastic traditions, and the trope of the chosen one. 
      <p>
          <h3>Appearances in other Discworld titles</h3>
          DEATH has the honour of being featured in nearly every Discworld novel. The only ones he's absent in are The Wee Free Men and Snuff. Sometimes it's only a small cameo, while in others he shows up more often.
          During the first two novels he had the dubious honour of trying to catch up to Rincewind, who unknown to him had attracted the protection of a God. From his supporting cast, there are moments when their names are mentioned
          in other novels, but these novels are rather standalone in that regard. I think this is one of the reasons a lot of people are recommended to start with the DEATH series as their first foray into the Discworld. They probably act as a 
          good introduction because a lot of concepts which return in other books are introduced or explained here.
