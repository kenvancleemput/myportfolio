    <h2>
        The Watch
    </h2>
    <p>
        <h3>Protagonists</h3>
        One of the most prolific series in the Discworld are the watch novels. Looking at the night watch in particular, we meet 4 characters in the first book. 
        Captain Vimes is the leader of the Night Watch, an alcoholic man who has lost all hope in a city where the thieves' guild has more power than the watch. Leading the team of 
        Sergeant Colon and Corporal Nobbs, their life is shaken about when a young dwarf, Carrot Ironfounderson, joins the Night Watch as a volunteer. Later novels include Angua von Ãœberwald, the watches' own werewolf,
        the troll Detritus, the zombie Reginald (Reggie) Shoe, and more. While the main viewpoint tends to stay with Vimes, Pratchett does dare to look into other character's minds when the story needs to. 
        Another recurring character here is Lord Havelock Vetinari, the patrician of Ankh-Morpork. Portrayed as a benevolent dictator, he rules the city with velvet gloves. Unless you're a mime, which he despises. He rules by the motto <q>One Man, One Vote</q>, which in this case means he is the Man, and thus it his Vote that counts.

        <h3>Antagonists</h3>
        Unlike with the DEATH series, there are no clear recurring villains here. While the supporting cast often stays the same, the nature of the books means that the villain is usually apprehended or killed by the end of the novel. After all, when your villain resists arrest, there are often casualties on both sides of the conflict. 
        Due to the mistery nature of the novels, I am loath to give away any names or events, as those might take away a big part of the joy of reading these books. If you already know who's done it, then there are no surprises to be had. So I will keep this section small and spoiler-free, to not take away any of your future enjoyment.

        <h3>Influences</h3>
        The Watch novels are not afraid to take on "big" subjects. Racism, inner-city conflict, slavery, drug use, gun control are all themes in the Watch novels. Unlike some of the other Discworld novels, there aren't clear influences that can be pinpointed. Character development on the other hand is rather strong here, with most characters growing and learning during and between books. 
        One of the most quoted parts of these books is the Vimes "Boots" theory of socio-economic unfairness, which I feel I should share with you: 
        <br><q>The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money. Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.</q>

        <h3>Appearances in other Discworld titles</h3>
        Since the city of Ankh-Morpork is a setting that often returns in Discworld novels, all the characters of the Watch seem to pop up with regular occurence. Later in the book series, when certain characters get more power and importance in the world, they can even be found outside the city walls. That's the great joy of having read all these books and knowing all the characters: you start to recognize them in different novels, and even without dedicating a lot of page time to them, their cameo's can make the world feel more alive. 
        Due to this, the careful reader will often find connections between narratives that aren't immediately obvious. Having Colon and Nobbs roam around the city, slacking off as much as they can, feels in character. Hearing the rumour that the watch has their own werewolf, and the theories surrounding that, makes the world feel more lived in.
