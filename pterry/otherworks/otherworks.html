      <h2>Other works</h2>
      <p>
          <h3>The Dark Side of the Sun and Strata</h3>
          Pratchett's first two novels for adults were science-fiction, although they already had a satirical streak in them. The dark Side of the Sun mainly feels like an Asimov novel, while Strata is a parody of Ringworld by Larry Niven. Strata notably has a world shaped as a disc.

          <h3>The Johnny books</h3>
          Set in the early nineties, these books mainly deal with perception. Strange things happen to Johnny, but it's often unclear whether these are real happenings or just figments of his imagination. Also aimed at younger readers, these novels are a good fit if you would like to see whether you could enjoy Pratchett's writing, without having to get invested in a 40+ series like Discworld, which can feel a bit daunting. Or exciting, you can decide that for yourself.

          <h3>The Bromeliad</h3>
          Another book aimed at children, we meet a clan of nomes who have found refuge in a large department store. Their lives are turned about when they find out that the Store is closing, and forces them out in to the larger world. As with all children novels Pratchett wrote, these can still be enjoyed by adult readers, although it would be the kind of story I would read to my children, if I had ever wanted any.

          <h3>Good Omens</h3>
          Probably the most well-known of his other works, this was cowritten with Neil Gaiman. Based on the premise of the Omen, they wondered what would happen if the Antichrist was given to the wrong family and grew up without the presence of satanists to guide him to armageddon. The other main characters are Aziraphale, an angel and Crowley, a demon. They've become so enamoured with life on earth, and humanity, that they decide to try and stop the Apocalypse. This is now a tv-series which I highly recommend, even if it's only for Michael Sheen as Aziraphale and David Tennant as Crowley.

          <h3>Nation</h3>
          Set in an alternative universe in a low fantasy setting of earth, this is another young adult novel. Dealing with loss, religion, and the need for people to work together even without a common language, it's a touching story (in my opinion). While there are fantastical elements, these are not as pronounced as in Discworld.

          <h3>Dodger</h3>
          Another children's novel, Dodger is based on the Dickens' character The Artful Dodger. Set in Victorian London, the book is filled with real and fictional characters, like Sweeney Todd and Benjamin Disraeli. A funny and light read, in which Pratchett for once portrays a romance between the characters, it's more funny if you know your Victorian age tropes and characters. Also, due to the inclusion of Sir Robert Peel (the father of modern British policing), it's not hard for readers to see the similarities between Ankh-Morpork and London on the one hand and Sir Peel and Samuel Vimes on the other.
