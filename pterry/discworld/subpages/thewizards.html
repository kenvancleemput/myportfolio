        <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-xl-3">
          <h3>Protagonists</h3>
          <p>
            It all started with Rincewind. A wizard who had one of the spells of
            creation in his head, which made for the fact that he could cast no
            other magic, as that spell was so scary that no other magic wanted
            to get in there. The eternal coward, his specialties are running
            away and surviving whatever the universe throws at him, to the
            chagrin of DEATH. There's also the Librarian, a wizard who got
            changed into an urang-utan and liked his new form so much that he
            made sure his true name vanished from the records of Unseen
            University. The cast got bigger with every additional book, with fan
            favourite Mustrum Ridcully taking the position of Archchancelor.
            There's also a younger batch, led by Ponder Stibbons, who built HEX,
            a thinking machine.

          <h3>Antagonists</h3>
          <p>
            As in other books of the series, there is no main villain to be
            established in the wizard books. The first novels, being spoofs of
            Western fantasy novels of the cold war, didn't need clear villains.
            Since Rincewind is a character that manages to be his own best
            enemy, he doesn't really need a clear antagonist. His bad choices
            manage to push the story forward enough that a villain who actually
            plots all these things would feel too random at most. It's actually
            a trait most of the wizards have to a certain degree. Although the
            case could be made that the main villain here is bureaucracy and
            tradition.

          <h3>Influences</h3>
          <p>
            The first novels were very much informed by Lord of the Rings by
            J.R.R. Tolkien, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser by Fritz Leiber, and
            Conan the Barbarian by Robert E. Howard. There's also parts riffing
            of Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCaffrey, and sections pointing to
            films and writings of the twentieth century. In later books,
            Rincewind travels to parts of the Disc we haven't seen yet, like the
            Agatean empire (clearly based on Imperial China and feudal Japan) or
            the XXXX continent, which is the Disc's Australia. There's also
            Unseen Academicals, which deals with football and fame, but sadly
            has a distinct lack of Rincewind.

          <h3>Appearances in other Discworld novels</h3>
          <p>
            In nearly any book set in Ankh-Morpork, there's a strong chance a
            wizard will show up. They also have cameo's in certain witches
            novels, and the Librarian gets deputised in one of the watch novels.
            In certain of the topical novels, the wizards play a part but aren't
            the main characters. For example, in Moving Pictures, which parodies
            films and celebrity culture, the Librarian becomes a big fan of the
            clickies, as films there are called. During Soul Music, several of
            the wizards start leading the rock and roll life, wearing leather
            jackets with inscriptions like "Born to Rune".
