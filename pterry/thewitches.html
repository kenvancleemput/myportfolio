  <h2>The Witches</h2>
  <main>
      <p>
          <h3>Protagonists</h3>
          We first meet Granny Weatherwax, the head witch, in Equal Rites. In her next showing, Wyrd Sisters, we are introduced to the rest of her coven, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick. Witches in the Discworld are often portrayed as being more sensible and realistic than the other residents of the Discworld, with Granny often being the one character that voices the major themes of Sir Terry's work. 
          Later on, the coven recruits Agness Nitt in Masquerade, a young witch who is literally in two minds about everything.

          <h3>Antagonists</h3>
          In the antagonist section we often find the more fantastical creatures of the Discworld. An ongoing fight seems to be between witches and the fae, who are more based on how the Fae used to be looked at by people than the current version. Or, as Lords and Ladies puts it: 
          <q>Elves are terrific. They beget terror</q>. Other opponents are vampires, siblings, or the witches' own pride. Due to these novels often being based on existing works in our own world, you can often find parodies of familiar villains. This is probably the series that is the most rewarding for people who have a well-read background.

          <h3>Influences</h3>
          As stated in antagonists, these books are based on works of fiction in our own world. There's Shakespeare, with the opening lines of Wyrd sisters clearly referencing Macbeth. Witches abroad focuses on faerie tales, and Lords and Ladies tackle the Fae. Carpe Jugulum is a vampire story.
          These obvious themes allow Pratchett to play with the tropes of their genre, and if you aren't known with those tropes, the comedy might not land as well.

          <h3>Appearances in other Discworld novels</h3>
          Both Granny and Nanny play a big part in the young adult Tiffany Aching series, which I'll cover under young adult. Also noteworthy is that in one of the Discworld computer games, you can find a Borrowing Granny Weatherwax on a slab, holding a "I aten't ded" sign. Borrowing is the skill that allows a witch to project her mind in an animal, but to passersby she might look just a bit dead. Hence Granny's precaution to make sure people understand that she is, in fact, rather alive.
