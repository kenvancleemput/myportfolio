          <h2>Life and death</h2>
          <p>
            Sir Terry Pratchett was an English novelist. Born April 28 in 1948,
            he rejoined his most popular anthropomorphic creation, DEATH, on
            March 12 2015 after a prolonged battle with early-onset Alzheimer's
            disease. During his life, he published and collaborated on over 50
            novels, and was awarded with a knighthood and an OBE.

          <h2>Career</h2>
          <p>
            He published his first novel in 1971. As most aspiring writers, he
            had a dayjob for the first twenty years of his writing career. He
            worked as a journalist for four nuclear power plants during that
            time. He himself said that if he'd ever write about that period,
            noone would believe the stories in that novel. His personal
            interests included computers, natural history, and astronomy.

        <h2>Writing</h2>
        <div class="col-12 col-xl-6">
          <p>
            He is mainly known for his Discworld series, but also contributed to
            other series and co-wrote a book with Neil Gaimann, of Sandman fame.
            His books have been turned into television films and series. Writing
            books for both adults and children, he was the best-selling novelist
            of the nineties in the UK.

          <h2>Influences</h2>
          <p>
            He was heavily influenced by the fantasy and science-fiction of the
            1950's and 1960's, and was a starch supporter of the fantasy genre,
            calling it the oldest genre known to man. His books often pointed
            out that imagination was the thing that made humans human, or as he
            pointed out in Hogfather: <br />
            <q
              >HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN. TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE
              FALLING ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE.</q
            >
            <br />
            He would often base characters on real-life counterparts, and give
            them a twist that made them recognizable but different enough for
            the well-read reader to spot the differences.
