          <h3>The Dark Side of the Sun and Strata</h3>
          <p>
            Pratchett's first two novels for adults were science-fiction,
            although they already had a satirical streak in them. The dark Side
            of the Sun mainly feels like an Asimov novel, while Strata is a
            parody of Ringworld by Larry Niven. Strata notably has a world
            shaped as a disc.

          <h3>The Johnny books</h3>
          <p>
            Set in the early nineties, these books mainly deal with perception.
            Strange things happen to Johnny, but it's often unclear whether
            these are real happenings or just figments of his imagination. Also
            aimed at younger readers, these novels are a good fit if you would
            like to see whether you could enjoy Pratchett's writing, without
            having to get invested in a 40+ series like Discworld, which can
            feel a bit daunting. Or exciting, you can decide that for yourself.

          <h3>The Bromeliad</h3>
          <p>
            Another book aimed at children, we meet a clan of nomes who have
            found refuge in a large department store. Their lives are turned
            about when they find out that the Store is closing, and forces them
            out in to the larger world. As with all children novels Pratchett
            wrote, these can still be enjoyed by adult readers, although it
            would be the kind of story I would read to my children, if I had
            ever wanted any.

          <h3>Good Omens</h3>
          <p>
            Probably the most well-known of his other works, this was cowritten
            with Neil Gaiman. Based on the premise of the Omen, they wondered
            what would happen if the Antichrist was given to the wrong family
            and grew up without the presence of satanists to guide him to
            armageddon. The other main characters are Aziraphale, an angel and
            Crowley, a demon. They've become so enamoured with life on earth,
            and humanity, that they decide to try and stop the Apocalypse. This
            is now a tv-series which I highly recommend, even if it's only for
            Michael Sheen as Aziraphale and David Tennant as Crowley.

          <h3>Nation</h3>
          <p>
            Set in an alternative universe in a low fantasy setting of earth,
            this is another young adult novel. Dealing with loss, religion, and
            the need for people to work together even without a common language,
            it's a touching story (in my opinion). While there are fantastical
            elements, these are not as pronounced as in Discworld.
          </p>

        <div class="col-md-6 col-xl-3">
          <h3>Dodger</h3>
          <p>
            Another children's novel, Dodger is based on the Dickens' character
            The Artful Dodger. Set in Victorian London, the book is filled with
            real and fictional characters, like Sweeney Todd and Benjamin
            Disraeli. A funny and light read, in which Pratchett for once
            portrays a romance between the characters, it's more funny if you
            know your Victorian age tropes and characters. Also, due to the
            inclusion of Sir Robert Peel (the father of modern British
            policing), it's not hard for readers to see the similarities between
            Ankh-Morpork and London on the one hand and Sir Peel and Samuel
            Vimes on the other.

          <h3>The Long Earth</h3>
          <p>
            A series written together with Stephen Baxter, this series takes a
            look at the theory that our reality is only one of many in the
            multiverse. When a technique is developed to travel to these other
            Earths, it doesn't take long before humanity sees the potential and
            starts exploiting these.
