          <h3>Protagonists</h3>
          <p>
            The main character in these books is Tiffany Aching, a young witch
            who we see grow up during the course of several books. She starts
            out as a nine-year old, but since time passes in the books, we
            follow her to adulthood. The Nac Mac Feegle are also worth
            mentioning, as they're pictsies who believe that they are in the
            afterlife. Small, blue and ferocious, they are known for fighting,
            drinking and stealing. Obviously Scottish, they were kicked out of
            Faeryland by the queen for being drunk at two in the afternoon and
            not knowing when to stop stealing.

          <h3>Antagonists</h3>
          <p>
            The queen of the fairies comes back several times, but she also
            faces down the Wintersmith (think Hades) and a hiver, a powerful
            being that can take over your body. Just like with some of the other
            main characters in Discworld, her own vanity and pride is a
            stumbling block to growing up. It's a theme that comes forward in
            many Discworld books, but here it's usually handled in a way that we
            can see Tiffany grow. For writers who want a masterclass in
            character development, you should look no further than these books
            on how to handle a person growing up in a believable manner, even if
            the world she lives in is highly fantastical.

          <h3>Influences</h3>
          <p>
            Terry Pratchett remarked that a lot of Tiffany's background was
            based on his own childhood and his experiences as a child. While
            there are several other threads running through all the novels in
            the series, like witch hunts and the place of mysticism in rural
            lives, there aren't as many obvious things you can point to and say:
            that's the idea that gestated this book. They were Pratchett's
            favourites, and before his death he spoke about the fact that these
            would be the novels he would like to be remembered for.

          <h3>Appearances in other Discworld novels</h3>
          <p>
            There aren't really any noteworthy appearances in other novels of
            Tiffany. The Nac Mac Feegle were introduced in the witches' novel
            Carpe Jugulum, it later turns out that one of the gnomes in the
            Watch is actually a feegle that lost his tribe.
