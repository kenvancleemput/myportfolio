          <h3>Protagonists</h3>
          <p>
            One of the most prolific series in the Discworld are the watch
            novels. Looking at the night watch in particular, we meet 4
            characters in the first book. Captain Vimes is the leader of the
            Night Watch, an alcoholic man who has lost all hope in a city where
            the thieves' guild has more power than the watch. Leading the team
            of Sergeant Colon and Corporal Nobbs, their life is shaken about
            when a young dwarf, Carrot Ironfounderson, joins the Night Watch as
            a volunteer. Later novels include Angua von Ãœberwald, the watches'
            own werewolf, the troll Detritus, the zombie Reginald (Reggie) Shoe,
            and more. While the main viewpoint tends to stay with Vimes,
            Pratchett does dare to look into other character's minds when the
            story needs to. Another recurring character here is Lord Havelock
            Vetinari, the patrician of Ankh-Morpork. Portrayed as a benevolent
            dictator, he rules the city with velvet gloves. Unless you're a
            mime, which he despises. He rules by the motto
            <q>One Man, One Vote</q>, which in this case means he is the Man,
            and thus it his Vote that counts.

          <h3>Antagonists</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike with the DEATH series, there are no clear recurring villains
            here. While the supporting cast often stays the same, the nature of
            the books means that the villain is usually apprehended or killed by
            the end of the novel. After all, when your villain resists arrest,
            there are often casualties on both sides of the conflict. Due to the
            mistery nature of the novels, I am loath to give away any names or
            events, as those might take away a big part of the joy of reading
            these books. If you already know who's done it, then there are no
            surprises to be had. So I will keep this section small and
            spoiler-free, to not take away any of your future enjoyment.

          <h3>Influences</h3>
          <p>
            The Watch novels are not afraid to take on "big" subjects. Racism,
            inner-city conflict, slavery, drug use, gun control are all themes
            in the Watch novels. Unlike some of the other Discworld novels,
            there aren't clear influences that can be pinpointed. Character
            development on the other hand is rather strong here, with most
            characters growing and learning during and between books. One of the
            most quoted parts of these books is the Vimes "Boots" theory of
            socio-economic unfairness, which I feel I should share with you:
            <br /><q
              >The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was
              because they managed to spend less money. Take boots, for example.
              He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really
              good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable
              pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then
              leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten
              dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and
              wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was
              in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles. But
              the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man
              who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be
              keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who
              could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars
              on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.</q

          <h3>Appearances in other Discworld titles</h3>
          <p>
            Since the city of Ankh-Morpork is a setting that often returns in
            Discworld novels, all the characters of the Watch seem to pop up
            with regular occurence. Later in the book series, when certain
            characters get more power and importance in the world, they can even
            be found outside the city walls. That's the great joy of having read
            all these books and knowing all the characters: you start to
            recognize them in different novels, and even without dedicating a
            lot of page time to them, their cameo's can make the world feel more
            alive. Due to this, the careful reader will often find connections
            between narratives that aren't immediately obvious. Having Colon and
            Nobbs roam around the city, slacking off as much as they can, feels
            in character. Hearing the rumour that the watch has their own
            werewolf, and the theories surrounding that, makes the world feel
            more lived in.
