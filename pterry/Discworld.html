    <h2>A look at the Discworld, fantasy's second largest book series</h2>
    <p>
        <h3>The Discworld in our world</h3>
      What started as a parody of post-war fantasy grew to be one of the largest
      (in word count) series to be published in the last 50 years. During the
      times it was being written, this changed to become a satirical look on
      many modern institutions. Due to Sir Terry's voracious reading, there were
      many historical facts interweaved with the narrative. Showing a keen
      insight into the human spirit, Sir Terry never forgot that at the heart of
      any novel are the people, and the journey they must make through the
      fantastical events.

        <h3>The Discworld</h3>
        Floating through space is the great turtle Ah'tuin. Carrying four large elephants 
        on its back (who also have names), it swims ever forward through the primordial muck. 
        On the backs of the elephants, we find the Discworld. Inspired by the saying that 
        <q>it's turtles all the way down<q>, we find a fanatasy world inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien 
        and sword and sorcery tropes from the postwar era. It has very specific rules, 
        like narrativia, and an new colour called octarine. In the beginning, we followed 
        the adventures of Rincewind, a wizzzard and his client, the tourist Twoflower, as they travel around the disc. 
        A recurring character in nearly every book is DEATH, the anthropomorphic representation of death, 
        and a parody of the grim reaper. Later novels even featured DEATH as a main character, and over the course of 41 novels
        many recurring characters are introduced.

      <h3>Themes</h3>
      In Discworld, there are a few recurring themes. There's the implementation of modern topics in a fantasy world 
      (e.g. popular music, movies, the financial system), a series of whodunit novels, a satirical look at fantastical fiction tropes (vampires, 
      tooth fairies, christmas) etc. A strong preference for humanism can be found in nearly all the novels, and in the Tiffany Aching books,
      which are aimed at younger readers, a focus on developing critical thinking skills. Due to the broad ranging of topics, I do believe that there 
      is a Discworld book for nearly everyone. They are also the perfect read for when you want to relax, as Sir Terry has the gift to explain 
      difficult concepts in both a humourous and simple way that never demand too much from the reader.
