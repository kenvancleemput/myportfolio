      Sir Terry Pratchett was an English novelist. Born April 28 in 1948, he
      rejoined his most popular anthropomorphic creation, DEATH, on March 12
      2015 after a prolonged battle with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. During
      his life, he published and collaborated on over 50 novels, and was awarded
      with a knighthood and an OBE.

      He published his first novel in 1971. As most aspiring writers, he had a
      dayjob for the first twenty years of his writing career. He worked as a
      journalist for four nuclear power plants during that time. He himself said
      that if he'd ever write about that period, noone would believe the stories
      in that novel. His personal interests included computers, natural history,
      and astronomy.

      He is mainly known for his Discworld series, but also contributed to other
      series and co-wrote a book with Neil Gaimann, of Sandman fame. His books
      have been turned into television films and series. Writing books for both
      adults and children, he was the best-selling novelist of the nineties in
      the UK.

      He was heavily influenced by the fantasy and science-fiction of the 1950's
      and 1960's, and was a starch supporter of the fantasy genre, calling it
      the oldest genre known to man. His books often pointed out that
      imagination was the thing that made humans human, or as he pointed out in
      Hogfather:<q
        >HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN. TO BE THE PLACE WHERE THE FALLING
        ANGEL MEETS THE RISING APE.</q
      >
      He would often base characters on real-life counterparts, and give them a
      twist that made them recognizable but different enough for the well-read
      reader to spot the differences.
