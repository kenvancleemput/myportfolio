        <strong>About Me</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        I'm a student at <a href="https://www.thomasmore.be/opleidingen/graduaat/programmeren-dag-avondonderwijs/programmeren-dagonderwijs/antwerpen">Thomas More</a> achieving a <strong>graduate degree in programming.</strong>. I was born in 1980, and currently live in <em>Berchem</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I take a daily walk. I read a lot for fun, and play both roleplaying and boardgames with friends on a regular basis. At home, I have two cats who demand my attention, which I am glad to give them.

        <strong>My history</strong>
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the past I've worked as an accountant for several multinational organisations, mainly in the shipping sector. Due to the ongoing automatisation, I came to the realisation that I needed to retrain myself to stay valid in an ever-changing society.
