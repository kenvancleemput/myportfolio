      <h2>Dungeon Crawl</h2>
      <p>
        For object oriented programming we had to make a text based game.
        Working from a starting code, we had to implement an adventure game
        reminiscent of the 1980's. For my project, I decided to take inspiration
        from roleplaying games.
      </p>
      <p>
        This challenged me in several ways. I had to find a way to make my
        player and monsters fight. I also needed to make sure that there were
        health recovery options, and to make it feel like a roleplaying game I
        wanted to implement player levels. To ensure that the player saw enough
        combat to challenge the final boss, I also made monsters spawn
        regularly, and had monsters roaming the dungeon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've put the code on
        <a href="https://github.com/kenvancleemput/DungeonCrawl">github</a>, but
        it is still very much a work in progress, as I plan to make sure it can
        be run by other people without having access to Java. I also want to
        make a graphical interface to increase atmosphere.
