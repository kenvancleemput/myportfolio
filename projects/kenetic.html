      <h2>Kenetic & The Dagda</h2>
      <p>
        What once started as a student job in the youth centre later grew into a
        small career as a DJ. Motivated in the beginning by free beer, that
        later grew into a mild obsession wuth music. This led to me performing
        to crowds ranging from fifty to about thousand people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Experiments like adding extra samples, sets with 3 cd-players and dj
        battles grew from this organically. There was a period you could find me
        nearly every weekend in some dark and sweaty room providing music. One
        of my personal highlights was winning a national competition to play as
        only one of three Belgian acts on a festival near Ghent. I also have
        fond memories of times where I got to play on the same stage as some of
        my favourite acts, and the compliments I got on my technical skills by
        these producers.

        These days it happens rarely that I still hit the decks. On those rare
        occasions it still happens, it's always at the impetus of friends. For
        example, on of the more fun things I've done was provide a soundtrack to
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108399/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"
          >True Romance</a
        >
        and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/">Panâ€™s Labyrinth.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Kenetic55/">Here</a> you can find some
        of my very old sets. I do have to give warning that this is music not to
        everyone's taste and that it might not be suitable to play this loud in
        a work environment
