      <h2>Young Adult books</h2>
      <p>
          <h3>Protagonists</h3>
          The main character in these books is Tiffany Aching, a young witch who we see grow up during the course of several books. She starts out as a nine-year old, but since time passes in the books, we follow her to adulthood. Having several important skills to witches (the first sight, allowing her to see what is really there, and second and third thoughts, which are the things you think about the way you think about the way you think), she gains the respect of Granny by venturing into Faeryland with the aid of the Nac Mac Feegle to save her brother Wentsworth. Later, she gets apprenticed to several other witches, including Nanny Ogg. Through the novels, we see her learn to stand on her own two feet, and account for things that she's done. The main strength of these novels is that they are written in such a way that they are also enjoyable by adults. The Nac Mac Feegle are also worth mentioning, as they're pictsies who believe that they are in the afterlife. Small, blue and ferocious, they are known for fighting, drinking and stealing. Obviously Scottish, they were kicked out of Faeryland by the queen for being drunk at two in the afternoon and not knowing when to stop stealing.

          <h3>Antagonists</h3>
          The queen of the fairies comes back several times, but she also faces down the Wintersmith (think Hades) and a hiver, a powerful being that can take over your body. Just like with some of the other main characters in Discworld, her own vanity and pride is a stumbling block to growing up. It's a theme that comes forward in many Discworld books, but here it's usually handled in a way that we can see Tiffany grow. For writers who want a masterclass in character development, you should look no further than these books on how to handle a person growing up in a believable manner, even if the world she lives in is highly fantastical.

          <h3>Influences</h3>
          Terry Pratchett remarked that a lot of Tiffany's background was based on his own childhood and his experiences as a child. While there are several other threads running through all the novels in the series, like witch hunts and the place of mysticism in rural lives, there aren't as many obvious things you can point to and say: that's the idea that gestated this book. They were Pratchett's favourites, and before his death he spoke about the fact that these would be the novels he would like to be remembered for.

          <h3>Appearances in other Discworld novels</h3>
          There aren't really any noteworthy appearances in other novels of Tiffany. The Nac Mac Feegle were introduced in the witches' novel Carpe Jugulum, it later turns out that one of the gnomes in the Watch is actually a feegle that lost his tribe.
