      <h2>The Wizards Series</h2>
      <p>
          <h3>Protagonists</h3>
          It all started with Rincewind. A wizard who had one of the spells of creation in his head, which made for the fact that he could cast no other magic, as that spell was so scary that no other magic wanted to get in there. The eternal coward, his specialties are running away and surviving whatever the universe throws at him, to the chagrin of DEATH. There's also the Librarian, a wizard who got changed into an urang-utan and liked his new form so much that he made sure his true name vanished from the records of Unseen University. The cast got bigger with every additional book, with fan favourite Mustrum Ridcully taking the position of Archchancelor. There's also a younger batch, led by Ponder Stibbons, who built HEX, a thinking machine.

          <h3>Antagonists</h3>
          As in other books of the series, there is no main villain to be established in the wizard books. The first novels, being spoofs of Western fantasy novels of the cold war, didn't need clear villains. Since Rincewind is a character that manages to be his own best enemy, he doesn't really need a clear antagonist. His bad choices manage to push the story forward enough that a villain who actually plots all these things would feel too random at most. It's actually a trait most of the wizards have to a certain degree. Although the case could be made that the main villain here is bureaucracy and tradition.

          <h3>Influences</h3>
          The first novels were very much informed by Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser by Fritz Leiber, and Conan the Barbarian by Robert E. Howard. There's also parts riffing of Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCaffrey, and sections pointing to films and writings of the twentieth century. In later books, Rincewind travels to parts of the Disc we haven't seen yet, like the Agatean empire (clearly based on Imperial China and feudal Japan) or the XXXX continent, which is the Disc's Australia. There's also Unseen Academicals, which deals with football and fame, but sadly has a distinct lack of Rincewind.

          <h3>Appearances in other Discworld novels</h3>
          In nearly any book set in Ankh-Morpork, there's a strong chance a wizard will show up. They also have cameo's in certain witches novels, and the Librarian gets deputised in one of the watch novels. In certain of the topical novels, the wizards play a part but aren't the main characters. For example, in Moving Pictures, which parodies films and celebrity culture, the Librarian becomes a big fan of the clickies, as films there are called. During Soul Music, several of the wizards start leading the rock and roll life, wearing leather jackets with inscriptions like "Born to Rune".
