        <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-xl-3">
          <h3>Protagonists</h3>
          <p>
            We first meet Granny Weatherwax, the head witch, in Equal Rites. In
            her next showing, Wyrd Sisters, we are introduced to the rest of her
            coven, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick. Witches in the Discworld are
            often portrayed as being more sensible and realistic than the other
            residents of the Discworld, with Granny often being the one
            character that voices the major themes of Sir Terry's work. Later
            on, the coven recruits Agness Nitt in Masquerade, a young witch who
            is literally in two minds about everything.

          <h3>Antagonists</h3>
          <p>
            In the antagonist section we often find the more fantastical
            creatures of the Discworld. An ongoing fight seems to be between
            witches and the fae, who are more based on how the Fae used to be
            looked at by people than the current version. Or, as Lords and
            Ladies puts it:
            <q>Elves are terrific. They beget terror</q>. Other opponents are
            vampires, siblings, or the witches' own pride. Due to these novels
            often being based on existing works in our own world, you can often
            find parodies of familiar villains. This is probably the series that
            is the most rewarding for people who have a well-read background.

          <h3>Influences</h3>
          <p>
            As stated in antagonists, these books are based on works of fiction
            in our own world. There's Shakespeare, with the opening lines of
            Wyrd sisters clearly referencing Macbeth. Witches abroad focuses on
            faerie tales, and Lords and Ladies tackle the Fae. Carpe Jugulum is
            a vampire story. These obvious themes allow Pratchett to play with
            the tropes of their genre, and if you aren't known with those
            tropes, the comedy might not land as well.

          <h3>Appearances in other Discworld novels</h3>
          <p>
            Both Granny and Nanny play a big part in the young adult Tiffany
            Aching series, which I'll cover under young adult. Also noteworthy
            is that in one of the Discworld computer games, you can find a
            Borrowing Granny Weatherwax on a slab, holding a "I aten't ded"
            sign. Borrowing is the skill that allows a witch to project her mind
            in an animal, but to passersby she might look just a bit dead. Hence
            Granny's precaution to make sure people understand that she is, in
            fact, rather alive.
