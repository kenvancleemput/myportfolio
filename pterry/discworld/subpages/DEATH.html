      <h2>The DEATH series</h2>

        <div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-xl-3">
          <h3>Protagonists</h3>
          <p>
            The main protagonists of the DEATH series of books is obviously
            DEATH, but also his extended family. There's his butler, Albert, and
            his adopted daughter Ysabell. The first book, Mort, introduces us to
            these three, as well as to his apprentice, Mort. He rides a white
            horse named Binky. In his second novel, Reaper Man, he gets fired by
            the Auditors, and hilarity ensues as he tries to adopt to a "normal"
            human life. In Soul Music, we meet Susan, DEATH's granddaughter, who
            has inherited certain family traits, like being able to pass through
            walls. When DEATH goes missing, she is expected to take up his
            mantle. In Hogfather, the titular character goes missing and DEATH
            tries to replace him so humanity keeps believing in the Hogfather, a
            Discworld standin for Santa Claus.In the meantime, Susan tries to
            find out what is happening and why her grandfather can be spotted
            with a fake beard... In Thief of Time, the story focuses on the
            monks of history, who make sure that time happens as it should. We
            also meet the fifth rider of the Apocalypse here, who left before
            they made it big.

          <h3>Antagonists</h3>
          <p>
            During the novels, DEATH has multiple runins with the Auditors of
            reality, the beings tasked with making sure that everything in the
            Discworld universe follows the Rules. Embodied as floating robes
            with a hive mind, they're not allowed to develop a personality or a
            sense of self. If one of them does so, they vanish and a new Auditor
            pops into place. They often clash with DEATH, as they would very
            much like the world to be less chaotic. This leads to several plots
            which DEATH has to stop. Renimiscent of classical accountants and
            auditors, they lack a sense of humour and can get easily distracted
            by illogical things. Another enemy of DEATH in one novel are his own
            memories, which lead to his disappearance in Soul Music and his
            attempt at forgetting the painful moments of his life. While handled
            quite humorously, anyone who has ever wished that they could forget
            certain parts of their own life will be able to step in his bones
            and walk his journey with him.

          <h3>Influences</h3>
          <p>
            Every novel has it's own theme and things that get ridiculed. Mort
            takes a look at apprenticeship and the expectation that young people
            can make the decision what They want to do with the rest of their
            lives. Reaper man takes a look at rural life, and how strange the
            human mind works when it comes down to rituals and habits. Soul
            Music has many references to sixties and seventies rock music,
            coupled with DEATH's depression. Hogfather looks at Christmas, and
            the role imagination plays in being human. It also riffs on Mary
            Poppins, when Susan takes a job as a caretaker of children. Thief of
            time looks at monastic traditions, and the trope of the chosen one.

          <h3>Appearances in other Discworld titles</h3>
          <p>
            DEATH has the honour of being featured in nearly every Discworld
            novel. The only ones he's absent in are The Wee Free Men and Snuff.
            Sometimes it's only a small cameo, while in others he shows up more
            often. During the first two novels he had the dubious honour of
            trying to catch up to Rincewind, who unknown to him had attracted
            the protection of a God. From his supporting cast, there are moments
            when their names are mentioned in other novels, but these novels are
            rather standalone in that regard. I think this is one of the reasons
            a lot of people are recommended to start with the DEATH series as
            their first foray into the Discworld. They probably act as a good
            introduction because a lot of concepts which return in other books
            are introduced or explained here.
